teaser: We take a look back at the cartography of the Final Fantasy franchise, beginning with the 1987 NES release and working our way forward in time.
---

_Final Fantasy_ for the NES helped to define video game maps, popularizing the idea of an abstracted overworld sprinkled with points of interest. More importantly, _Final Fantasy_ gave the player a world big enough to make them rely heavily upon a digital map, recognizable landmarks, and a good working knowledge of the surrounding geography.

Later titles in the franchise would develop on this premise, adding complexity and graphical polish, but still maintaining the idea of exploring a vast world map. With the move to the PlayStation 2 and _Final Fantasy X_, the series would shift from abstracted overworlds to 3D environments, requiring a similar shift in mapping techniques.

We'll be focusing on the main-series (from I to XIII), single-player Final Fantasy games which saw original U.S. releases. Let's take a look...

# NES

## _Final Fantasy_ (1987)

The original _Final Fantasy_ takes what we would now consider to be a basic approach to in-game cartography. There is a traversable overworld (seen in __1__), which includes abstracted representations of landmarks. In a style that has since become commonplace, players travel long distances by traversing this overworld, stopping in at towns and other points of interest along the way.

For a full view of the world, a broom in [Matoya's Cave](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Matoya's_Cave) (__2__) teaches the player a "magic spell" consisting of pressing B and SELECT simultaneously. This command brings up a true world map (__3__), which indicates the player's current location and gives them a sense for the geography of the playable area.

# SNES

## _Final Fantasy IV_ (1991)

{% include gallery.html %}

Originally known as _Final Fantasy II_ in North America, _Final Fantasy IV_ followed in the footsteps of previous Japan-only release _Final Fantasy III_ by requiring the player to learn a spell ([Sight](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Sight)) or use an item ([Gnomish Bread](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Gnomish_Bread)) before they could view a map of the world.

Without any spells or items, players see the overworld (__1__). However, once the player acquires a hovercraft, their view of the world expands (__2__). This view takes advantage of the [Mode 7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_7) graphical feature of the SNES to scale the background world texture such that it tapers off toward the top of the screen and creates the impression of a 3D environment.

To get an even broader view of the world, the player can use Sight (__3__) or Gnomish Bread. The resulting map (__4__) is simply a zoomed-out view of the nearby overworld.

## _Final Fantasy VI_ (1994)

{% assign gallery = 'final_fantasy_6_overworld_3.png, final_fantasy_6_overworld.png, final_fantasy_6_overworld_4.png, final_fantasy_6_flying.png' %}
{% include gallery.html %}

Originally known as _Final Fantasy III_ in North America, _Final Fantasy VI_ doubled down on the use of Mode 7 to create an even more 3D-looking world. It also featured two distinct maps: the World of Balance and the World of Ruin.

The basic overworld view (__1__ and __2__) is similar to that seen in previous games, but a new minimap has been added in the bottom-right corner. This minimap proves useful when flying quickly over the world (__4__), but it also consumes valuable screen real estate and can sometimes feel more obligatory than elegant.

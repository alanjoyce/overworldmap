teaser: Overworld Map is becoming a part of a larger project&#58; Tilting at Pixels.

I started Overworld Map as a venue for discussing the intersection of two things I have an intense interest in: cartography and video games. However, I quickly came to realize that devoting an entire website to this junction point alone did not leave me much freedom to explore beyond a rather narrow set of topics.

As a result, I am now rolling Overworld Map into a larger project: [Tilting at Pixels](http://tiltingatpixels.com).

You'll be able to find Overworld Map posts on the new site inside the [Overworld Map category page](http://tiltingatpixels.com/overworld-map/) and hopefully on the main page with some degree of regularity.

Many thanks to those who have contacted me expressing interest in the premise of Overworld Map, and I hope you will give Tilting at Pixels a look as well.

Cheers!

The goal of _Overworld Map_ is  to study the maps, indicators, and interfaces that have helped players find their way through three decades of video games.

These decades have included years of experimentation with game-related cartography, from printed paper and cloth maps to interactive, searchable, digital ones. This evolution is a fascinating study in cartographic technique, visual aesthetics, and interface design, which deserves to be fully explored and documented.
